# roblox-change-font
This is instructions on how to put JetBrains Mono to the Roblox client. Credits to JetBrains for the font and Grammarly for fixing the text.

## License
JetBrains Mono license:
```JetBrains Mono typeface is available under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 license and can be used free of charge, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not need to give credit to JetBrains, although we will appreciate it very much if you do.```

## WARNING
Could you make sure to back up Source Sans fonts in case you want to change it back? Also, there may be issues with the font, for example, the spacing in chat, etc. I am not responsible for the issues that will happen, please take caution.

This is still in development, and I did not ask Roblox for permission. It is not illegal for "hacking", because it is just changing fonts, that's all. I respect Roblox's TOS, so should you.

# Instructions on Windows
Done on Windows 10, Windows 11 is just a copy of Windows 10, just UI updates.

Make sure you are on AppData/Local/Roblox/roblox-client-version/ (roblox-client-version is in this case, the version of the Roblox client - warning, not the Roblox Studio one). Go to the contents folder, and copy both Source Sans and Gotham fonts from the "needed" folder to the fonts folder.

# Instructions on Mac
Done on macOS 12 on an Early 2015 MacBook Air (outdated, but still runs Roblox decently)

The instructions are a little bit different than the one for Windows. Make sure you are in the Applications folder, and search for the Roblox app. Then right-click on the Roblox app and then click on "View package contents". Go to Contents/content/, and then copy both Source Sans and Gotham fonts to the fonts folder.

## Extras
This is optional.
If you want to lose â‰ˆ16.3MBs of space, follow this step.
Go to /Contents/PlatformContent/pc/fonts/, on Windows: /PlatformContent/pc/fonts/ and replace NotoSans font with the one from the extras folder.

# Updates
There may be updates to README.md, like adding further improvements, to adding photos (may be done). Updates may take long.
